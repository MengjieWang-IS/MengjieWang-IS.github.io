I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information, Technology, and Operations Management (with a concentration in MIS) at the Rady School of Management, University of California, San Diego. My research focuses on digital platforms, with particular interest in the creator economy, influencer marketing, livestreaming, and e-commerce. I use a combination of causal inference methods, field and lab experiments, and machine learning techniques to study how information disclosure and platform design influence user behavior and outcomes across creators, consumers, and advertisers.

Before beginning my doctoral studies, I earned an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and worked as a Data Scientist in the U.S. for two years. I also completed two research-based summer internships as an Economist at Amazon, experiences that continue to inform both my research and teaching. My industry background positions me well to teach data-driven courses at both undergraduate and Master’s levels in business schools.

I am currently on the 2025–2026 academic job market and seeking a tenure-track position as an Assistant Professor in Management Information Systems or related fields.
