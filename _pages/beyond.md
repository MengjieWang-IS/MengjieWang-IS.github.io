Outside of research, I enjoy keeping life balanced with hobbies that exercise both my body and imagination.

Sports & Fitness
======
I’m an avid tennis player (around USTA 3.5), and Roger Federer is my all-time favorite player — I admire both his elegance and consistency. Off the court, I enjoy weight training and am currently studying for the ACE personal trainer certification — a very “researcher habit” of mine, haha. I also practice Pilates, which helps with balance and control. Together, these cover cardio, strength, and functionality — my personal formula for health. Honestly though, one big motivation for working out is so I can eat more of the unhealthy food I love without too much guilt!

Gaming
======
I’ve been playing League of Legends for over 13 years. These years, I mostly play ARAM for fun, usually picking the most beautiful magical champions (and yes, I can’t resist buying skins for them). For me, it’s about the joy of flashy spells and good aesthetics more than pure competition. I also love console games like Black Myth: Wukong, Assassin’s Creed, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. My passion for video games and esports even flows into my research, especially in studying livestreaming platforms such as Twitch, the global hub for gaming communities.

Script Murder
======
Another hobby of mine is Script Murder, a social role-playing game that has become very popular among young people in China. Players dive into scripted stories, take on different characters, and work together to either solve mysteries or experience emotional journeys. Sometimes it’s about piecing together a murder case; other times, it’s about living through love, betrayal, or destiny. For me, it’s a creative escape, a way to vent emotions, and an opportunity to meet up with friends.
