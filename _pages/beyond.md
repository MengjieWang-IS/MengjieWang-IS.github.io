Outside of research, I like to keep life balanced with hobbies that exercise both body and imagination.

Sports & Fitness
======
I’m an avid tennis player (I once competed in USTA 3.5 singles), and Roger Federer is my all-time favorite player — I admire both his elegance and consistency. Off the court, I enjoy weight training and am currently studying for the ACE personal trainer certification. I also practice Pilates, which helps with balance and control. Together, these cover cardio, strength, and functionality — my personal formula for health. Honestly though, one big motivation for working out is so I can enjoy good food without worrying too much about diet.

Gaming
======
I’ve been playing League of Legends for over 13 years. These days, I mostly hop into ARAM matches for fun — always picking the most beautiful magical champions. I admit I have a weakness for buying skins; if a champion looks stylish and sparkly, chances are I’ve already unlocked it. ✨ Outside of LoL, I also enjoy console games like Black Myth: Wukong, Assassin’s Creed, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. My passion for video games and esports even connects to my research interests, particularly in livestreaming platforms like Twitch, the global hub of gaming communities.

Script Murder
======
Another hobby of mine is Script Murder, a social role-playing game that has become very popular among young people in China. Players dive into scripted stories, take on different characters, and work together to either solve mysteries or experience emotional journeys. Sometimes it’s about piecing together a murder case; other times, it’s about living through love, betrayal, or destiny. For me, it’s both a creative escape and a way to share stories with friends.
