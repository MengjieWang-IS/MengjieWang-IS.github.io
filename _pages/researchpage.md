### When Viewers Stay: Emotional Attachment as a Moderator of Ad Avoidance in Livestreaming
*Mengjie Wang, Zhe Zhang.* Major Revision at MIS Quarterly

The fast growth of the livestreaming and influencer marketing industries raises a
research question on how streaming sponsored content affects streamers’ viewership.
Unlike traditional media or pre-recorded social media formats, livestreaming entertainment 
utilizes real-time interaction between content creators and viewers. This fosters
emotional connections that may moderate viewers’ negative responses to advertising
content. This emotional connection is an important potential moderator to understand
in the study of influencer marketing. We analyze high-frequency data from Twitch.tv,
examining how transitions from organic to sponsored content affect concurrent viewership. 
Overall results show that sponsored segments result in a 13.7% decline in
concurrent viewership. However, this negative effect is significantly moderated by two
novel proxies for emotional attachment. We observe that streamers who engage in
increased viewer interaction (through the ”Just Chatting” content category), or those
who do not solely specialize in a single game content category, experience smaller
viewership losses. Content changes associated with sponsorship also partially explain
the negative effect of sponsorship. We also find no evidence of negative long-term viewership 
impacts on a streamer following sponsored sessions. This research contributes
to the literature on ad avoidance, influencer marketing, and livestreaming entertainment
by identifying emotional attachment as a novel moderator, particularly relevant in
interactive media contexts. Our findings offer practical implications for both brands
selecting streaming partners and content creators managing sponsored marketing.

### Facilitating Streamer Collaboration through Tags: Evidence from Twitch
*Mengjie Wang, Zhe Zhang.* Data analysis and draft in progress

The livestreaming industry has experienced rapid growth, becoming a major segment of the digital content economy. 
Twitch, as the market leader, has introduced a series of features since 2023 designed to facilitate collaborations among streamers. 
While collaborations are common on social media (e.g., co-created videos or posts), they typically originate offline 
and are not directly structured by the platforms themselves. Twitch’s strategy, therefore, represents a novel platform-level 
intervention to actively foster collaborative interactions. This study examines the impact of Twitch’s collaboration-focused 
features on both platform- and streamer-level outcomes, and investigates how collaboration shapes performance, engagement, 
and value creation. By highlighting collaboration as a critical yet understudied mechanism, this research extends the literature 
on livestreaming and offers practical guidance for both platforms and content creators.
