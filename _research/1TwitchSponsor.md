Abstract
---
The fast growth of the livestreaming and influencer marketing industries raises a
research question on how streaming sponsored content affects streamers’ viewership.
Unlike traditional media or pre-recorded social media formats, livestreaming entertain-
ment utilizes real-time interaction between content creators and viewers. This fosters
emotional connections that may moderate viewers’ negative responses to advertising
content. This emotional connection is an important potential moderator to understand
in the study of influencer marketing. We analyze high-frequency data from Twitch.tv,
examining how transitions from organic to sponsored content affect concurrent view-
ership. Overall results show that sponsored segments result in a 13.7% decline in
concurrent viewership. However, this negative effect is significantly moderated by two
novel proxies for emotional attachment. We observe that streamers who engage in
increased viewer interaction (through the ”Just Chatting” content category), or those
who do not solely specialize in a single game content category, experience smaller
viewership losses. Content changes associated with sponsorship also partially explain
the negative effect of sponsorship. We also find no evidence of negative long-term view-
ership impacts on a streamer following sponsored sessions. This research contributes
to the literature on ad avoidance, influencer marketing, and livestreaming entertainment
by identifying emotional attachment as a novel moderator, particularly relevant in
interactive media contexts. Our findings offer practical implications for both brands
selecting streaming partners and content creators managing sponsored marketing.
